# Project InSiN, Group 1

This project is developed an intrusion detection system(IDS)
in the course _Intelligente Sicherheit in Netzwerken_
at the _Technische Universitaet Berlin_ in the summer term 2017.
We are _group 1_. The members(contributors) are listed below.<br/>
More precisely, the goal is to develop an IDS on a given dataset, in our case
[CTU-13](http://mcfp.weebly.com/the-ctu-13-dataset-a-labeled-dataset-with-botnet-normal-and-background-traffic.html),
with a number of self chosen machine learning algorithms.
We focus on the K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm, but will also implement and test
some others.

##How-To

This section focuses on hot to use our project. We divided the project into two
parts.
The first part _data-preparation_ has the purpose to convert the CTU dataset to
[arff](https://weka.wikispaces.com/ARFF) files,
which can then be used by [weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)
for the IDS system.
The second part _IDS_ is the IDS system.
In that part the training and testing of our algorithm on the data to detect
anomalies is done.
Both parts are described in the following.

### Convert data from CTU-13 to Arff


### Perform intrusion detection
